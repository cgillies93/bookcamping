Say goodbye to bookings and make family memories for life at Cottonwood Cove. Available lots start from $95,000 and range in size from 128m2 to 339m2. Purchasers have the option to upgrade their lot and personalize their space with a custom deck, fence, or storage shed. Members of the resort can have peace of mind knowing that the property boasts year-round security, maintenance, and long-term storage options during the shoulder season that runs from late October through to the end of April.
